Challenge 1: The Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem) provides instructions for creating a JavaScript function that prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100 and outputs the corresponding grade. The grade scale is defined as follows: A: 80-100 B: 60-79 C: 50-59 D: 40-49 E: Less than 40

To implement this, you need to write a JavaScript function that takes a score as input and returns the corresponding letter grade based on the provided scale. The function should include conditional statements to check the score against the defined ranges and return the appropriate grade message for each range.

Challenge 2: The Speed Detector (Toy Problem) gives instructions for creating a JS function that prompts Speed Detector (Toy Problem)ts the user to input the car speed and outputs a command . The description is as follows : The program should take the speed of a car as input, e.g., 80 km/h. If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it should print "Ok." For every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), it should give the driver one demerit point. The program should print the total number of demerit points. For example, if the speed is 80 km/h, it should print: "Points: 2." If the driver accumulates more than 12 points, the function should print: "License suspended."

Challenge 3 :

Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.
